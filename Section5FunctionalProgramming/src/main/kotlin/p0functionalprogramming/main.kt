/*

Functional Programming :

Pros :

- No messy state issues (because only use immutable data)
- Easier code reuse (peer functions only depend on their parameters, so reusing them and testing them is easy)
- Safe multithreading ()

Cons :

- functional programming don't have loops  (recursion)  -> less efficient code
- harder to conceptualize
